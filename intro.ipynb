    "This session will take a deep dive into some research data management best practices when developing in a Jupyter environment. The focus will be on ensuring reproducibility of analysis and bundling up code and data for use by others. This will be examined in two ways: moving your project to Github, and remixing/extending work that already exists. Participants will need a GitHub account for the session that can be created [here](https://github.com/join)."
