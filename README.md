# RDM in Jupyter: The importance of keeping your data reproducible

## What

This session will take a deep dive into some research data management best practices when developing in a Jupyter environment. The focus will be on ensuring reproducibility of analysis and bundling up code and data for use by others. This will be examined in two ways: moving your project to Github, and remixing/extending work that already exists. Participants will need a GitHub account for the session that can be created [here](https://github.com/join).

## When 

Tuesday, February 28, 9:00 - 11:30 AM EST. [Details and sign-up]()
