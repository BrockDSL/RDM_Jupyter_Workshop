# RDM in Jupyter: The importance of keeping your data reproducible

## What

This session will take a deep dive into some research data management best practices when developing in a Jupyter environment. The focus will be on ensuring reproducibility of analysis and bundling up code and data for use by others. This will be examined in two ways: moving your project to Github, and remixing/extending work that already exists. Participants will need a GitHub account for the session that can be created [here](https://github.com/join).

## When 

Tuesday, February 28, 9:00 - 11:30 AM EST. [Details and sign-up]()


## Who

Workshop will be co-lead by:

**Tim Ribaric** 

[Tim](https://twitter.com/elbitronic) is the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Brock University. He holds a Masters of Computer Science and is currently completing his PhD in Educational studies. He is a big fan of Github as a resource for researchers and uses Jupyter notebooks for almost all of his research, including his most recent Web Archives analysis platform called [All Our Yesterdays](https://brockdsl.github.io/AOYTK/). He is the instructor for the [ibrary Juice Academy [Python for Librarians](https://libraryjuiceacademy.com/shop/course/270-python-for-librarians/) course, which is of course all written in Jupyter Notebooks.

**Cal Murgu** 

Cal is the Instructional Design Librarian at Brock. Prior to Brock, he was the Digital Humanities Librarian at the New College of Florida (Floridaâ€™s Honour College). He also teaches Digital Humanities and LIS at Western University in the Fall semesters. His current research project investigates how interactive digital notebooks can be used to help non-programmers learn to use and manipulate web archives. Cal is something of a jack-of-all-trades technologist who works with the Brock Digital Scholarship Lab whenever possible.
